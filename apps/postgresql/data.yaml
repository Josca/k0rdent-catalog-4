  PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, rich feature set, and strong
  performance, backed by over 35 years of active development. It supports complex queries, extensibility, and full ACID compliance.

  PostgreSQL can be deployed and managed at scale using k0rdent, making it a robust choice for multi-cluster environments.
  The broader open source community offers extensive knowledge and support, helping users get started, deepen their expertise,
  and stay connected.
